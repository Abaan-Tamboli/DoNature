# DoNature
 
DoNature is a web-based platform that aims to help people donate extra food to those in need. The website is built using web technologies and will use Firebase and other Google technologies to facilitate the process of food donation.

The website works by allowing users to sign up and create an account. Once the user has created an account, they can navigate to the "Donate Food" section of the website. Here, they can enter details about the food they would like to donate. This includes information such as what type of food it is, when it will be ready for pick-up, and where it is located.

After the user has entered this information, they can submit it to the website. The system will then match the food with people in need who are located nearby. The system uses geolocation technology to determine which people are closest to the donated food.

The system will notify the appropriate recipient(s) via email or SMS once a donor has submitted their donation. They will then be able to coordinate with the donor to arrange for pickup/delivery of the food.

The platform also allows users to donate money to support the platform's operations or to sponsor the delivery of certain types of food (such as fresh produce or dairy products).

Overall, DoNature is a powerful tool that utilizes web technology to make the process of donating food more efficient and effective. By connecting donors with recipients in need, it helps reduce waste and ensure that people who need food are able to access it more easily.
